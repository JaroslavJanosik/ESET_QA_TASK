Eset Task1 solution

Test approach:
An execution of a regression test suite based on an application specification to confirm that the application works as expected.
Because of a time limitation the tests are defined according a basic users scenarios to cover up a critical functionality.
Since later it can be automated easily I leverage Gherkin syntax and a set of special keywords to give structure and meaning to executable specifications. 
I chose Windows 10 Home edition as testing environment running on my personal laptop due to current availability and the time limitation. 
A clean installation of the operating system was executed 22.4.2020 so there are enough operating system logs to be collected. 
Machine does not have an ESET security product installed so only Windows event logs and running processes dumps can be collected.

Test enviroment: Windows 10 Home edition v1909 (18363.1198)
Application: SET Log Collector Application v2.0.6.0. (ENU language location)

Scenario: Run an application with elevated user rights (as an administrator)
  Given Windows 10 Home v1909 (18363.1198) run enviroment
  And machine does not have an ESET security product installed
  When user runs the logcollector.exe file as an administrator
  Then the application is open
  When user clicks on the Close button
  Then the application is closed without errors

Scenario: Run an application in safe mode (not clear from an assignment whether the app does not start at all or a collecting process is interrupted)
  Given Windows 10 Home v1909 (18363.1198) run enviroment
  And machine does not have an ESET security product installed
  When user runs the logcollector.exe file in safe mode (without administrators rights)
  Then the application is not open ???

Scenario: Check a default app setting
  Given Windows 10 Home v1909 (18363.1198) run enviroment
  And machine does not have an ESET security product installed
  When user runs the logcollector.exe file as administrator
  Then the application is open
  When user checks a default app setting 
  Then all available artifacts <artifacts> are selected by default
  And the logs age limit is 30 days
  And the logs collection mode is Filtered binary
  And the archive file name and location is already predefined
  
  Test data:

  | artifacts                                        | 
  | Running processes (open handles and loaded DLLs) |  
  | Application event log                            |
  | System event log                                 |
  | SetupAPI logs                                    |
  | System configuration                             |
  | Network configuration                            |
  | WFP filters                                      |  
  
Scenario: Collecting data based on the default app setting
  Given Windows 10 Home v1909 (18363.1198) run enviroment
  And machine does not have an ESET security product installed
  When user runs the logcollector.exe file as administrator
  Then the application is open
  When user clicks on Collect button
  Then a collection process is running  
  And user can view the operation log window at the bottom to see what operation is currently in progress
  When the collection is finished
  Then a success pop-up message is open
  When user opens a predefined archive's directory
  Then the archive file has been saved in the predefined location as a .zip file with a predefined name 
  When user extracts the archive file
  Then the archive contains the given files <location/file name>
  When user checks the Windows\Logs\Application.xml file
  And user checks the Windows\Logs\System.xml file
  Then log evens are not older than 30 day

  Test data:

  | location/file name                  | 
  | metadata.txt                        |  
  | collector_log.txt                   |
  | Windows\Processes\Processes.txt     |
  | Windows\Logs\Application.xml        |
  | Windows\Logs\System.xml             |
  | Windows\Logs\SetupAPI\setupapi*.log |

  | Config\SysInspector.xml             |
  | Config\WFPFilters.xml               |

Scenarion: Collecting data when a .zip file with a predefined or custom name already exists
